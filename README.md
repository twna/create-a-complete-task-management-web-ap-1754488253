# Create a complete task management web application with:
    1. Frontend: Modern React-based UI with task creation, editing, and filtering
    2. Backend: REST API with Express.js, task CRUD operations, and data persistence
    3. Database: MongoDB integration with proper schemas and connections
    4. DevOps: Docker containerization and deployment configuration
    
    The agents should coordinate to ensure:
    - Frontend API calls match backend endpoints
    - Database schemas align with backend models
    - Docker configuration includes all services
    - Consistent data flow between all components
